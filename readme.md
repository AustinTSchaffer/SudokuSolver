# Sudoku Solver

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Sudoku solver.

Some of the sudoku-solving strategies used in this module were crafted based on
strategies that I have used to solve Sudokus. Other strategies and strategy
descriptions have been borrowed from [SudokuWiki](https://www.sudokuwiki.org/),
which has an exhaustive list of strategies that can be used to solve Sudokus.
This site is a great resource is you are looking for strategies to improve your
own personal games and contains to a wealth of strategies that were not included
in this project.
